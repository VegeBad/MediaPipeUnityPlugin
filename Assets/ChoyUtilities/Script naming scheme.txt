Script naming scheme:

(Prefix) Mono- 		    : Monobehaviour class that is not part of Baker<>, static or singleton
(Prefix) UI- 		    : Monobehaviour class that is a UI widget
(Suffix) -Bridge	    : Monobehaviour class that is not a singleton, doesn't have Baker<> but serves as a bridge between Monobehaviour and ECS
(Suffix) -Manager	    : Monobehaviour class that is a "don't destroy on load" singleton
(Suffix) -Controller    : Monobehaviour class that is a local scene singleton
(Suffix) -Authoring	    : Monobehaviour class that contains Baker<> class

(Prefix) I-             : Interface

// Below is for ECS component, since IComponentData itself is an interface 
// so they they all have the "I" keyword

(Suffix) -IData		    : Standard IComponentData struct that contains data
(Suffix) -ITag		    : Empty IComponentData that serves as a tag
(Suffix) -IEnableable   : Struct that implements both IComponentData and IEnableableComponent
(Suffix) -IEnableableTag: Combined IEnableable and ITag
(Suffix) -IClean        : Struct that implements ICleanupComponentData
(Suffix) -IBuffer	    : Standard IBufferElementData struct
(Suffix) -ISingleton    : IComponentData that meant to serve as a singleton

// ECS doesn't have the usual static class reference in OOP, 
// so the singleton here just means there will be only one entity with this component during runtime
// any less or more than 1 will return an error

(Suffix) -SystemBase    : Class that inherits from SystemBase
(Suffix) -ISystem       : Struct that inherits from ISystem
(Suffix) -SystemGroup   : Class that inherits from ComponentSystemGroup

(Suffix) -System        : Special non-Monobehaviour class, usually require a constructor

(Suffix) -Attributes    : Any ScriptableObjects

(Prefix) E-             : Enums

(Suffix) -Serialize     : Any class/struct with [Serializable] attribute

(Suffix) -Collection    : Usually a partial class of HelperCollection, 
                          is for a static class that holds a bunch of static methods and extensions 
                          
(Suffix) -Editor        : Editor class for customized view

// Editor class I rarely open a new file and put it in the Editor folder, unless the script is too huge
// Most of the time I'll just put directly under the corresponding classes
